<h1>SMS Spam Detection</h1>
<p>Recognizing the pervasive issue of SMS spam, there
is a critical need for robust detection mechanisms. Despite con-
tinual advancements in the field, achieving accurate SMS spam
detection remains a challenging endeavor. In response to this
challenge, our paper introduces an adept framework designed
for efficient SMS spam detection. We leverage the capabilities of
six machine learning algorithms or methods, namely SVM, kNN,
Na√Øve Bayes, Random Forest, Logistic Regression,and Decision
Tree. This framework is rigorously evaluated across three diverse
datasets: "Spam SMS classification," "SMS spam collection
Dataset," and "Spam/Ham SMS data."To assess the performance
of our framework, we employ standardized metrics such as
accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 score. Notably, the SVM, Sup-
port Vector Machine, consistently emerges as the top-performing
algorithm. Specifically, in the "Spam SMS classification" dataset,
SVM achieves an exemplary F1 score of 0.69. Transitioning to
the "SMS spam collection Dataset," SVM leads with the highest
accuracy, registering an impressive 0.90. The trend continues in
the "Spam/Ham SMS DataSet," where SVM once again excels
with a commendable accuracy of 0.90.This success is attributed
to the strategic utilization of SVM, Although it gives the same
percentages as Random Forest and Decision Tree algorithms
in the 3 datasets but capitalizes on its proficiency in handling
high-dimensional spaces, managing non-linear relationships, and
exhibiting a faster runtime when compared to Random Forest
and Decision Tree algorithms. The efficacy of our framework
across diverse datasets underscores the significance of thoughtful
algorithm selection in crafting an adept SMS spam detection</p>
framework.
